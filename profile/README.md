## Hi there and thank you for your interest in The Nexus Reborn
The main goal of this project is to bring back some of The Nexus MC's game modes, mainly Survival Games and MCSwat. We do have some plans in regards to other gamemodes, but these will mostly be decided upon by the community when the time comes

You are free to fork/clone the repositories here as you see fit, however the code and projects are highly tailored to The Nexus Reborn specifically. However I do plan on splitting some of these things into their own libraries.
At this time, we use Java 8 and Spigot 1.8.8. However there are some plans to change this in the future

Please feel free to contribute to the project as you see fit, please make sure you follow proper Java Naming Conventions
